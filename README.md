TERA-BOT
========
A old video of it in action : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_mT3uHDJdw

I've been working on this project throughout 2013, of course it was for educational purposes only. However, due to legal troubles I decided to make it open source as of 2014. Enjoy! Also, remember to give PROPER credits if you plan on updating/releasing/or using the source code. 

Example of what to do - Here is this sweet program I made with the help of (https://github.com/Keldeo/TERA-BOT). Thanks Zeke!

Example of me hunting you down and killing you - Here is this sweet program that I totally made alone for this game tera that Zeke did not make at all.


Thanks a bunch.
