TERA-BOT
========
A old video of it in action : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_mT3uHDJdw

I've been working on this project throughout 2013, of course it was for educational purposes only. However, due to legal troubles I decided to make it open source as of 2014. Enjoy! Also, remember to give credits if you plan on updating/releasing/or using the source code. 

Thanks a bunch.
