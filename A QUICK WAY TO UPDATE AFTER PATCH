Wondering how to find all the pointers, offsets, and base addresses all over again after a patch?
Chances are you will have to manually via pointer scans and etc. However, there is a trick to find the most common base
address that is located in 90% > of what I though < usefull offsets. By finding this you can find what you need 
a bit faster.


Ready for this sweet info? I was to lazy to finish making an aob for this so my method is a little strange.

K. Here is what you need to do.

Get on le cheat engine.
Switch to String. (unicode? I think? If you get no green addresses or you get nothing try with out it.)
Search C1D
You should get addresses that look like this : http://i.imgur.com/sXMf0Lg.png
Next, browse each green address in Memory View
Look around for something that looks similar to this : http://prntscr.com/2lelkd
Okay you are probably asking "DAFAQ? ZEKE?!" why that? The answer is simple.
Go back a few bytes (about 4), and look at it again while comparing what you found with this picture below.
It hardly ever changes : http://prntscr.com/2lel0s <- Two versions Fall / Winter 2013
Well... that is if TERA Employees never look at this github which will probably not happen.


Enjoy!

PS - Don't be a credit whore and start claiming everything in my github yours just because you think that I'm not on
your forum or enmasse is not watching you. I'll just give a warning to everyone. Companies can kill you with Lawsuits. 
You are violating their TOS/EULA by doing this and there is no way out 99.99% of the time. So GG yah kiddies. 
So enjoy your FREE education from me and make some useful programs in life with some of the funtions in my TERA-BOT.
