Wondering how to find all the pointers, offsets, and base addresses all over again after a patch?
Chances are you will have to manually via pointer scans and etc. However, there is a trick to find the most common base
address that is located in 90% > of what I though < usefull offsets. By finding this you can find what you need 
a bit faster.
